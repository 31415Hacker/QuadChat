# Versioning

Current: 1.4.9
Rules:
- Bump patch (last number) by 1 on every non-testing/developing commit
- Patch can go to any number (1.4.10, 1.4.19, etc.)
- Ask before bumping minor (second number) — reserved for big changes
- Only bump major (first number) when explicitly told to

# Build & Deploy

- Built with `npm run build` (Vite)
- Deployed on Vercel (auto-deploys from main branch)
- Dev server: `npm run dev` (Vite, --host 0.0.0.0)

# UI

- Commit hash shown at bottom of users sidebar (`.commit-fineprint`): `commit {__COMMIT_HASH__}`
  - Injected by Vite at build time from `git rev-parse --short HEAD`
  - Styled in `styles.css`: left-aligned, subtle opacity

# Known Fixes

## P2P Group Call — Second Person Can't Connect
- Root cause: stale participant cleanup in `joinP2PGroupCall()` removed any participant with `joinedAt` older than 30s — if two people joined more than 30s apart, the second person deleted the first from the participants list and never connected.
- Fix: removed the stale cleanup entirely. `onDisconnect().remove()` already handles abandoned participants.

## 1-to-1 Call — Sudden Disconnects
- Root cause: `oniceconnectionstatechange` called `cleanupCall()` immediately on `"disconnected"`, which is often transient (Wi-Fi blip, lag spike).
- Fix: added a 10-second grace period before cleaning up on `"disconnected"`. If ICE recovers to `"connected"` or `"completed"` within 10s, the cleanup is cancelled. Only `"failed"` cleans up immediately.
- Applies to both caller and callee sides.
